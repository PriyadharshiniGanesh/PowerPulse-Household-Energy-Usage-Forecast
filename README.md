Introduction
	PowerPulse, built a machine learning model to predict household energy consumption. This project showcases how data science can empower both households and energy providers to make smarter, greener choices in energy management. In today's world, efficient energy management is essential. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model using historical energy consumption data. With actionable insights, households can reduce costs, and energy providers can optimize demand forecasting and resource planning.


Features and Approach: 
• Data Understanding and Preprocessing: Explored the dataset to uncover patterns and address inconistencies. Parsed time and date features and created rolling averages for deeper insights.
• Feature Engineering: Identified relevant predictors for global active power consumption. Integrated statistical methods to enhance predictive power.
• Model Development: Built and trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. Optimized their performance using hyperparameter tuning by leveraging GridSearchCV to test various hyperparameter values and select the best-performing model. 
• Model Evaluation: Assessed models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of energy usage.
• Insights and Visualizations: Delivered clear insights into usage trends, such as peak hours and seasonal patterns.
• Results: Accurate energy consumption predictions with actionable insights. Forecasting tools to help households monitor usage and reduce energy bills.
